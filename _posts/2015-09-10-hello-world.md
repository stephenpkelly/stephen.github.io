To the guy and girl that land on this page (thanks for the two Google Analytics hits... much appreciated) this is my very own website.

I would like to mainly use this space to put up mini projects that I'm working on, so plan on it being pretty data science focused. That said, I'll probably talk about anything and everything.

I'm very new to the whole website building thing- but for anyone interested this site is generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

Racking my brain trying to think of something witty or interesting to say but ... ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

I'll leave that till the first post.
