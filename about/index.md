Hi everyone, my name is Stephen Kelly.

I'm an analyst and developer based out of Dublin, Ireland and I enjoy all things data science related.

Background:
  * I have always been very fond of grand structures and in 2011 I graduated from DIT with a BEng in Structural Engineering. Engineering was always about the problem solving for me and in my penultimate year of study a lecturer of [mine](http://www.colincaprani.com/) introduced us to programs he had devolved for structural analysis. I was fascinated at how simple yet complex they were. From there my focus shifted to data and modelling. Although I still marvel at great engineering and architectural feats around the World, in truth I fell out of love with the limitations Joe Engineer had.  
    I enjoy and relate to this quote by Jack Handey when I think of my engineering days
	>I had dreams once. Once I wanted to build the world’s longest suspension bridge. But then I found out someone else had already done it.

  * Further education was on the horizon and I wanted it to combined data, programming and problem solving. So in 2012 I entered a one year full-time MSc program. At that time and lucky for me the program was heavily funded by some European body (can't think of the name but thanks guys) so it was easy on the wallet. The program itself was MSc, Business Analytics from UCD Michael Smurfit Graduate Business School and had modules ranging from _Quantitative Methods_ and _Applied Probability & Statistics_ to _Simulation Modelling and Analysis_ and _Network Software Modelling_, to name a few.
  
    The cornerstone of the program was a dissertation. I undertook mine with [Coillte](http://www.coillte.ie/) the Irish State Forestry Company pronounced ˈkəilʲtʲə (good luck :)). It was incredible to delve into such an unusual domain and I am going to dedicate a full post to this project. But for those of you who can't wait its titled _Prediction of Forestry Planned End Products Using Dirichlet Regression and Neural Networks_ and was published [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.5849/forsci.14-023).

As stated above I'm currently an analyst at an eCommerce telecommunications company with a main focus on fraud prevention and payment conversion.

Currently working on a few mini projects that I will share with you guys. Any queries you can reach me at [stephen_kelly@outlook.ie](mailto:stephen_kelly@outlook.ie)
